Use Case-1:

create table petrol (ID_Distributer STRING,Name_Distributer STRING,amt_IN STRING,amt_OUT STRING,vol_IN INT,vol_OUT INT,year INT)  row format delimited  fields terminated by ","  stored as textfile;

load data local inpath ‘/home/cloudera/ICP4/petrol.txt’ into table petrol;

Queries:

--> what is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor?
SELECT Name_Distributer,SUM(vol_OUT) FROM petrol GROUP BY Name_Distributer;

--> Which are the top 10 distributors ID’s for selling petrol and also display the amount of petrol sold in volume by them individually?
SELECT ID_Distributer,vol_OUT FROM petrol order by vol_OUT desc limit 10;

--> Find real life 10 distributor name who sold petrol in the least amount?
SELECT ID_Distributer,vol_OUT FROM petrol order by vol_OUT limit 10;

--> The constraint to this query is the difference between volumeIN and volumeOuT is illegal in real life if greater than 500. As we see all distributors are receiving patrols on every next cycle.List all distributors who have this difference, along with the year and the difference which they have in that year.
SELECT Name_Distributer,(vol_IN-vol_OUT) as Difference,year FROM petrol GROUP  BY Name_Distributer,Difference,year having (vol_IN - vol_OUT) > 500;
